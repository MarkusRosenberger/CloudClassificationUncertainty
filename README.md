# Uncertainty of SYNOP cloud classifications by human observers

This repository contains code, which complements the work of Rosenberger et al. submitted to Meteorological Applications in Jan 2026

In this work the reliability and agreement of human cloud observations according to the WMO SYNOP scheme for operational cloud observations was investigated using three different experiments. 
Experiment 1 compares observations of seven different observers at the same weather station. Experiment 2 compares cloud observations at three close weather stations over the course of more than 50 years. 
And experiment 3 compares observations of five volunteer meteorologists based on ground-based RGB images to the ground truth but also the respective other participants.
